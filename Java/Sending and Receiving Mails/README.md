# Bivolarov Stoyan - Personal Project


==========================================

Introduction to the subject of the project
----------------------------------------

``````
We propose to model the distribution of mail: every day, residents send mail to others
residents of the same city or another city.
These letters must be placed in mailboxes and these letters are delivered the next day.

``````

HOW TO:
---------
    1. Open a Linux terminal and run:
        * Execute the command: `mvn package`
        * If you want to generate the project javadoc: `mvn javadoc: javadoc`
        * You have generated a .jar file with `mvn package`
        * Execute the command: `java -jar target/TP3-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

    2. If you want to see the design of my project: I created a file called CourriersUML.ucls which is at the root of the project. This file opens using Eclipse and ObjectAid (plugin for Eclipse).
