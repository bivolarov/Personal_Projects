# You cannot see the final product of the project , because is using the university server and the university data base .
# You can just look up the code .
# Basically is an online application that gives you all the gas station(their services and all other stuff) in function of your position .
# It's using a Json File(Given from the university) with all the coordinates of the Gas Stations , so I can position them on the map .
# You can give a comment and like a post under every Gas Station and dynamically uploads to the data base .
